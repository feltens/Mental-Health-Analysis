# Mental-Health-Analysis
Description An analysis of mental health from 2016 to 2020, exploring factors like gender, age, treatment-seeking behavior, and workplace mental health benefits. It includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to uncover insights and support mental wellness in professional environments worldwide.

## About the Project

This project was developed as part of academic activities at PUCRS (Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul). The main objective was to analyze mental health data in professional settings from 2016 to 2020. The analysis investigates key factors such as gender, age, treatment-seeking behavior, the impact of workplace mental health benefits, and global disparities based on countries' GDP.

Originally created in Portuguese, this repository has been translated into English to expand its reach and facilitate international collaboration.

## Data Sources

The dataset used in this project consists of survey responses collected from 2016 to 2020, provided by Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI). Additionally, GDP data for 2016 was used to analyze global disparities. The datasets were cleaned and combined to ensure consistency and facilitate analysis.

## Objectives

The project aims to answer six key questions:
1. Are there significant differences in mental health between genders over the surveyed years?
2. Are there significant differences in treatment-seeking behavior between genders?
3. Are there significant differences in mental health across age groups over the years?
4. Are there significant differences in treatment-seeking behavior across age groups?
5. Do employees of companies offering mental health benefits seek treatment more frequently?
6. Are there significant differences in mental health between high-GDP countries in 2016?

## Key Findings

- **Gender**: Men consistently reported higher diagnosis rates, but treatment-seeking behavior varied.
- **Age Groups**: Adults (25–64) had the highest diagnosis and treatment-seeking rates, while seniors (65+) showed the lowest.
- **Workplace Benefits**: Employees with access to mental health benefits sought treatment more frequently.
- **Global Disparities**: High-GDP countries exhibited significant variation in mental health diagnosis rates, highlighting cultural and systemic differences.
